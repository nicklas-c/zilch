# Content Authoring
We will use thios folder to collaborate on content generation and improvement.  

Content will typically be written for publication in the company's internal Confluence site, but other destinations are possible: for example, Word docs, emails, presentations, etc.
## Structure
The output of our collaboration should be in placed in the output/ folder.  Use short meaningful filenames in lower kebab case.

## Format
* Unless otherwise specified, all content should be in markdown format.
* prefer asterisks over hyphens for bullet lists.

## Standing Instructuions
* At all times we will work collaboratively to generate content.  You can suggest drafts, bu never take an initial brief and run with it to generate complete documents on little or assumed input.
* It is always worth considering the audience for the document.  If the intended audience is unclear, clarify and use for context.  Including a note on the intended audience in the document will mean you won't haveto clarify when returning to work on an existing document.
