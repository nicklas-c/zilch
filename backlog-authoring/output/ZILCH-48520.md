# ZILCH-48520

## Summary
Correct banner copy for Anywhere unlock

## Description
When a customer activates an Anywhere unlock (enabling their Zilch card for use at any retailer), the storefront displays a banner confirming the card is enabled. Previously, Anywhere unlocks had separate flows for in-store and online. Another team recently delivered a unified card unlock experience that merged these into a single flow. When this was delivered, the adaptive storefront banner was not updated to reflect the unified experience.

With the `adaptive-storefront-header` feature flag enabled, the banner currently shows "Shop Anywhere in-store", which is misleading — it implies the card can only be used in-store, when the unified Anywhere unlock is now channel-agnostic. With the flag disabled, the previous banner showed copy along the lines of "Card is enabled to pay over 6 weeks Anywhere", which correctly described the feature without narrowing the channel.

The `adaptive-storefront-header` flag is currently enabled for 20% of customers as part of an A/B test, so the incorrect copy is visible to all users in the test group who perform an Anywhere unlock.

This story adds appropriate channel-agnostic banner copy for the Anywhere unlock case when the adaptive storefront header is enabled.
