# Draft — no Jira key yet

## Summary
Define a test policy for the Merchant team

## Description
The team currently has no documented test policy, leading to repeated discussions about what testing is required to progress a ticket through QA. Author a single Confluence page, under [Unicorn Operating Processes](https://payzilch.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UN/pages/3940941929/Unicorn+Operating+Processes), that provides clear guidelines on what types and levels of testing are necessary and sufficient for common types of change — covering both front-end and back-end, and addressing the full range of test types including unit, component, integration, and end-to-end. The document does not need to be exhaustive; it is acceptable for some changes to still require individual consideration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The document has been presented to the team in a dedicated review session
- Feedback from the session has been considered (not necessarily acted upon)
