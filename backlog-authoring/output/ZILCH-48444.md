## Summary
Exclude boost from rewards calculation

## Description
When a customer makes a credit purchase that includes a boost, rewards are currently calculated on the full transaction value (loan + boost). This story changes the rewards calculation to exclude the boost portion, so that rewards are earned only on the loan amount.

### Example
A customer makes a £120 purchase using a £20 boost. The loan amount is £100. Currently, rewards are calculated on £120. After this change, rewards are calculated on £100 only.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Rewards calculation excludes boost
**Given** the customer has made a credit purchase with a boost
**And** the customer has made their repayments on time
**When** the customer makes their last repayment
**Then** rewards are earned
**And** the rewards earned are based on the loan amount only

### Scenario 2: Purchase without boost is unaffected
**Given** the customer has made a credit purchase without a boost
**And** the customer has made their repayments on time
**When** the customer makes their last repayment
**Then** rewards are earned
**And** the rewards earned are based on the full transaction value
