# Categories Banner

## Context
The Categories page is a key discovery surface in the Zilch app, listing product categories (e.g. Electronics, Entertainment, Health & Beauty) that customers browse to find retailers.  The page currently has no promotional placement.

The sales team has identified demand for a new advertising placement on this page.  A rotating banner component already exists in the app (e.g. at the top of search results), so there is an established pattern to build on.

## Description
Introduce an auto-rotating promotional banner carousel at the top of the Categories page.  Banner content will be managed through ContentStack, giving the sales team control over what is displayed without engineering involvement.  Each banner will support configurable link destinations (ECJ links, deep links to content pages, and external links) and click tracking.

The feature will be gated behind a LaunchDarkly flag for controlled roll-out.

## Statement of Value
Opens a new revenue stream by providing the sales team with an additional paid advertising placement on a high-traffic page.

## Test Plan
Standard.  QA to verify banner display, rotation, link navigation, click tracking, and LaunchDarkly flag gating across both iOS and Android.

## Deliverables
* Front-end changes to display and rotate banners on the Categories page (no back-end changes required)
* ContentStack content type and configuration for the Categories banner placement
* LaunchDarkly flag for controlled roll-out
* Notification to the sales team that the new placement is available in ContentStack
