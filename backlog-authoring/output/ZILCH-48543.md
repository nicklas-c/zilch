## Summary
Add rotating banner to Categories page

## Description
The Categories page lists product categories (e.g. Electronics, Entertainment, Health & Beauty) that customers can browse to discover retailers. This story introduces an auto-rotating promotional banner carousel at the top of the Categories page.

The banner is paid-for advertising space, giving the sales team a new placement to sell to advertisers. Banner content will be managed through ContentStack, allowing the sales team to control what is displayed without engineering involvement.

A rotating banner component already exists elsewhere in the app (e.g. at the top of the search results page). The rotation rate should match the existing search results banners.

Each banner must support a configurable link destination. Supported link types include ECJ links, deep links to content pages, and external links.

The feature should be gated behind a LaunchDarkly flag.

## Open Questions
- **Banner design**: Should this follow the same design as the existing search results banner, or does the product designer need to provide a specific layout?
- **Manual swiping**: Can customers swipe between banners manually, or is it auto-rotation only?
- **Position indicators**: Should there be dots or similar indicators showing the number of banners and current position?
