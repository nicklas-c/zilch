### 2026-02-04 Exit Interview

**Preamble**
- Offered him the chance to discuss anything before my questions.
- Nothing he wanted to raise. Mentioned he has an HR exit interview tomorrow in the last hour before his leaving drinks.

**Feedback on team**
- Doesn't feel he has feedback he hasn't shared along the way.
- Has enjoyed the team — thinks they're good people, working well.
- Acknowledges some challenges working with Ossie that he has discussed previously.
- Nothing new.

**Feedback on me as manager**
- Very appreciative. Thinks he's learnt a lot from me.
- Appreciates the rigour I've brought to process that was lacking at Zilch before.
- This was his first job after uni — had nothing to compare with. I gave him insight into how more established companies work.
- Likes that I dig into technical details to understand what's actually happening.

*Critical feedback (pressed for):*
- Thinks I'm a blocker quite often.
- Sometimes intentional and appropriate — being the right quality gate.
- Sometimes it's lack of responsiveness — especially in Slack threads.
- I acknowledged finding Slack to be a firehose of information.
- He couldn't come up with specific examples but will consider and get back to me.

**Advice for Stefan (his backfill)**
- Lean into the chaos. Zilch treats firefighting as BAU.
- At first it can feel like constant emergency mode, but that's just Zilch's default. Once you realise that, you can stop letting it stress you out.
- "It's not about being complacent and not jumping on things, just not doing that at the cost of your sanity."
- Pleased we're getting a very experienced FE engineer as his replacement.
- Notes that Chris Walker is great as the competency lead for front end engineering, but doesn't have a huge amount of experience.

**Frustrations held back**
- Feels like he's expressed them all.
- Promotion felt late: lack of agility in the promotional cycle held him back by about six months.
  - *My note: I agree. It was frustrating not to be able to promote him out of cycle when the L2→L3 promotion was clearly deserved.*
- Frustrated with lack of reliable priorities from ExCo and the product org.
  - Often means we only ever deliver MVP.
  - Start with a great vision, but what's delivered is minimal at best.
  - Less concerned about code quality — more about UX quality and lack of completeness in deliveries.
- The pace of work at Zilch means important but peripheral tasks get rushed past.
- Questionable motivations: not looking at the end goal — focused on the next shiny object rather than the grand end goal. Motivation isn't to make something good, but to tick a box for the next quarter.

**Wrap-up**
- Gave him positive feedback: hadn't written an appraisal since he's leaving, but if I had, I'd have noted his growth in maturity — from hero developer to an enthusiastic engineer working within the constraints of appropriate process. Phenomenal contribution.

**Note on Rory**
- In response to this praise, Alex mentioned he really sees the difference when comparing how he now works versus how Rory works.
- Rory continues to grab at the next task and put himself into the critical path rather than working with measure and process.
- *Potentially useful feedback for Rory or his manager.*
