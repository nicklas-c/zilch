# Writing a Good Epic

A well written epic should be easy to understand by anyone familiar with Zilch and its product. Writing a clear epic that does not assume prior knowledge of specifics ensures that ambiguity is minimised and that we have a clear record for posterity of the work done and its motives.

Consider including sections for the following where appropriate.

| Section | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Context or Background** | Context-setting information that may not be part of the actual delivery, but sets the scene and helps readers to understand the feature request. |
| **Description** | A clear, concise description of the feature or work. |
| **Statement of Value** | A declaration of the value the epic will deliver in business terms. |
| **Implementation Notes** | Any up-front thoughts about what implementation might involve. Don't over-do this. The epic is not the place for full design documentation. |
| **Out of Scope** | Declaration of anything that may be inferred as in-scope, but that is out of scope. This can also be a useful way to manage stakeholder expectations. |
| **Success Criteria** | A note of what success of the epic looks like. Importantly, this is not the same thing as Acceptance Criteria: ACs should be noted on individual PBIs. An epic may be delivered according to all the requirements, and meet all its PBIs' acceptance criteria, but still not meet its success criteria if the feature turns out not to have the value anticipated. |
| **Risks** | The epic description is a good place to note any risks foreseen. |
| **Test Plan** | Some notes on how the epic will be tested may add value if the test approach needs to differ from the norm. |
| **Roll-Out Plan** | Likewise, if roll-out is non-standard, some notes will add value to the epic. |
| **Deliverables** | A list of deliverables for the epic removes ambiguity. Consider not just software releases, but documentation, training, analytical metrics, operational metrics, and alerts. |
