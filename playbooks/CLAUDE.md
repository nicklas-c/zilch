# Playbooks

## Purpose
This folder contains a set of playbooks for common tasks.  Playbooks will detail step-by-step approaches and checklists of things that need to be in place for activities such as preparing for, and running, a sprint planning meeting.

## Role of AI
You will partner with me to refine and improve playbooks to help optimmise processes.  You'll do this by challengineg and prompting me in the manner of a rubber duck.

You'll also use these playbooks to deduce potential next steps when considering my upcoming tasks.

## Structure
This folder will maintain a flat structure: containing one file per process and no subfolders.
