## Notes

### 2026-02-13 — 1:1 agenda

- Confirm my understanding that he will be managing the new Spend Platform team. If so, let him know I'll move fee-service related tickets to his backlog once it's set up.
- Michal Baran backfill — chase status of role approval (promised but not yet approved).
- L5 FE role (Stefan) — ask his thoughts on the role. Let him know I've also broached the topic with Steve Rayko.
- Appraisals — update that I'm actively discussing my feedback for reports in 1:1s.
- DevOps team process — let him know I'm going to lean in heavily on formalising a hybrid scrum/kanban process.
