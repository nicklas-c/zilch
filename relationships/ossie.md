## 2025 year-end appraisal

### His self-appraisal

#### Achievements
* Played foundational role in component test pack (Maestro/Pact) by implementing mocks for all the key APIs the app invokes from startup to landing on the storefront. This allowed us success in getting the app to boot completely and build test suites from.

* Proud to take ownership of and deliver the UI for the new Rewards Hub feature. This was the first feature I was able to leverage the advantages of the Pact mock server to mock the APIs and gain confidence in functionality before integrating with the backend.

* Vastly improved quality of code in Image Optimiser lambda. In an attempt to fix a retailer icon bug (which was later fixed in the UI), this refactor led to improved test coverage, logging and flexibility in adding new image processing strategies if and when needed.

#### Growth Areas
* This year I have given a couple of demonstrations which have garnered some positive feedback from within and outside the team for quality of presentation. Public speaking is not an activity I particularly enjoy, but I do believe I am good at presenting technical and customer facing features in a way that is clear and engaging. I think this is a skill that would serve me well to hone so that I can effectively communicate my ideas and showcase pride in mine and the team's success. With this, the emphasis is on being given the space to do so rather than expectation.

* I would like to participate earlier in the discovery of new initiatives and features, working closer with Product and Design to help shape the product backlog items and how we deliver them.

* I would like to work on becoming a little bit more experimental and flexible in my approach to engineering. Rather than taking a lot of time mulling over technical design, I would like to develop confidence to start implementing and iterate quickly.

### My appraisal of Ossie
#### Impact
Ossie has been a steady contributor through 2025.  He's at his best when he's engaged in a medium to large piece of work, and acknowledges he thrives when he is able to get in the zone and focus.


He thinks deeply about problems and their solutions and cares that solutions are elegant and appropriate. 


He is right to identify ownership of the Image Optimiser, and it has been good to see him get closer to the UI Test Pack work: he appears to be positioning himself well to ensure some continuity when Alex leaves.


He is also right to identify his presentation skills - he structures information well and shows good awareness of the audience's need for context.

#### Growth Areas
Ossie's instinct to provide the best solution to a problem can sometimes result in him being hesitant at the start of a piece of work.  I'd encourage him to find some way to come to a decision sooner and move into gear quickly.  I'm encouraged to see that he has identified this in his self-appraisal, and if working in a more 'experimental' fashion helps then I'd encourage that.


A fear of missing out, or a sense that he should be aware of the many discussions happening in various channels, can sometime be a distraction from his preferred heads-down in-the-zone approach.  He could allow himself to shut out the noise and focus and trust that he can catch up later if he needs to.
