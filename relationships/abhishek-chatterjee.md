# Abhishek Chatterjee

## Context for AI
Architect at Zilch. Not a direct report — peer/stakeholder relationship. Regular check-ins to stay aligned on architectural decisions affecting Merchant and DevOps teams.

## Running Notes

### Check-in — 2026-02-11 (planned)

#### Talking Points

1. **Pending Rewards (ZILCH-48222)** — Technical discovery spike that will produce an ADR. Architectural review is expected. How does Abhishek want to be involved? (Review the ADR, attend a design session, async, etc.)
2. **Gateway Service (ZILCH-40366)** — Jacek raised a question about whether to use a new gateway or proxy through customer-service. Is there an existing architectural position, or does this need a broader discussion?
