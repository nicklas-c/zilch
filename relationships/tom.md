**Talking points:**
1. Status of Nikos's defect analysis project
2. Appraisals — how did he appraise himself? (Haven't seen his since he reports to Nikos)
3. Maestro project — is he comfortable running with it once Alex leaves (tomorrow)?

### 2026-02-05 — 1:1 notes

**React Native update**
- Merging today, out with next release
- Very confident — thinks should have gone live a month ago
- Recent issues have been minor cosmetic fixes; would have preferred a big push to get them all done sooner

**Maestro**
- Test pack ready to be turned on in CI/CD pipeline on PR
- All front-end engineers will benefit (shared project)
- Will then start removing Appium tests — only keep where full E2E is required
- Confident taking it forward without Alex; one test still needs fixing, but other engineers know how to use it

**Defect analysis**
- Going fine
- Raising questions about whether we need an SLA for defect resolution — some stale defects

**Team dynamics**
- Nick H still pushes back on writing E2E tests
- Nikos has guidance: integration tests sufficient if change is internal to service with no API changes
- Encouraged Tom to treat Nikos's rule as guidance, not absolute — he has authority to decide test strategy and should feel able to say "this is what I expect"
- Thinks things are improving: pipeline changes mean actual benefits to writing E2E tests (automatic promotion to production)
- Could move many Fee Service E2E tests to integration testing under Nikos's guidance, but wouldn't want to move all

**Appraisals**
- Nikos wrote his appraisal (not me). Nikos didn't ask for my input, but asks periodically through the year.
- Feedback from Nikos:
  - Needs to take leadership duties as seriously as technical/testing duties *(I agree)*
  - Emphasis on incorporating AI
  - Didn't do as well as he could have on Memberships work — Tom attributes this to being brought in late; would have preferred earlier involvement
  - Feedback about ContentStack — feels like becoming an SME is being pushed at him
    - I expressed uncertainty about why this would fall to QA — doesn't fit the function

**Other topics**
- Gated content release approval process (segued from ContentStack discussion)
- Mutation testing initiative: wasn't on his radar at all; discussed merits and issues; he hasn't done much with it in the past
