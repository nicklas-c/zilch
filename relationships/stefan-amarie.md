# Stefan Amarie

## Context for AI
Front End Engineer (Level 5), based in London. Reports to me. Joining the Merchant team — Zilch's first L5 FE hire. Expected to provide FE engineering leadership beyond the Merchant team.

## Running Notes

### 1:1 with Andrzej — 2026-02-16

Andrzej's view on what Stefan should be considering in the L5 role:
- How competent the front-end team is, what gaps it has, and how to help close them.
- Defining an engineering roadmap for the front end.
- Replacing Chris Walker as competency lead (with a possible move for Chris into the DevOps team as an expert on the platform for delivering FE code to prod).
