### His self-appraisal

#### Achievements
During the last year at Zilch, as a DevOps Engineer, I made significant contributions to enhancing our deployment processes, monitoring capabilities, and development workflows. My key accomplishments include:
* Developing Helm libraries for AWS resources such as SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, and S3 using Crossplane. These libraries enable the creation of ephemeral resources that are utilized during Zephyr environment creation.
* Introducing and configuring quality gates for our services. Almost all services now have quality gates in place. I worked closely with QA engineers to ensure they were configured correctly with an appropriate and effective set of tests.
* Focusing heavily on our roadmap, particularly its main goals: Zephyr and the Zoe Operator for ephemeral environment creation. I spent a significant amount of time preparing services to be fully deployable from scratch, including fixes to Spring configuration, Liquibase changelogs, and dependency configurations. Additionally, I prepared Redis and WireMock configurations for ephemeral environments.
* Introducing Argo Rollouts into production environments, simplifying the release process and enabling more flexible deployment strategies.
* Created a scaffold/template for new Golang services
* Developing multiple GitHub Actions to accelerate deployments and provide clearer, more actionable results.
* Supporting fellow engineers through the tech-devops channel by guiding them on workflows, CI/CD, and testing strategies, while collaborating closely with software engineers, QA engineers, and other DevOps engineers to align on release processes, testing workflows, and Argo CD best practices.
* Actively participating in staff testing events. Additionally, I actively participated in the on-call rota, which helped me gain a deeper understanding of the product and site reliability.
* Developing workflows that integrate with TestRail and Slack to deliver automatic, real-time notifications of test results.

#### Growth Areas
Looking back over the last 12 months, I see a few areas where I can increase my impact. While I’ve delivered well on technical work, I could do a better job of proactively sharing progress and outcomes so the value of DevOps initiatives is more visible across teams.

Technically, I want to deepen my knowledge of Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and Crossplane, especially around monitoring and improving ephemeral environment creation time. I’d also like to focus more on Zoe (Zephyr Orchestration Engine) development. This would give me the opportunity to strengthen my Golang skills while contributing more directly to a core platform component.

### Final Summary
Over the past year at Zilch, I’ve continued to grow my impact as a DevOps Engineer, focusing on improving our platform foundations, deployment processes, and CI/CD workflows. A key focus was supporting roadmap initiatives such as Zephyr and Zoe, preparing services for fully reproducible, ephemeral environments and improving overall production readiness, including the introduction of Argo Rollouts.

I worked closely with software engineers, QA engineers, and other DevOps engineers to align on release processes, testing workflows, and best practices. Overall, this year has been a strong step forward, and I’m motivated to make an even bigger impact next year.

### My appraisal of Lukasz

#### Impact
Lukasz has had a very strong year. He started with a conspicuous awareness of his position as the most junior member of the team, coupled with an awareness that he lacked some of the technical skills of his teammates. In the past twelve months he has taken proactive ownership of his own learning path and has grown in confidence visibly.

His growth in confidence is matched by his contribution: Lukasz has contributed to many key projects, operating well across a broad reach of the tech and tool stack. His self-appraisal appropriately illustrates that his contributions have been substantial and technical.

He's well-respected and well-liked within the team and across the organisation. He works well with the rest of the team and is recognised as cheerfully helpful.

#### Growth Areas
Lukasz's helpfulness is a genuine strength, but as he matures as an engineer he should consider how to balance it with process and priority: sometimes "you're in a queue" is a more appropriate answer than "yes, I'll do it now". Learning to manage expectations without losing the willingness to help will serve him well.

As Lukasz grows into more senior roles, he should also think about how he frames information for different audiences. He tends to lead with details rather than context, which works well within the team but may need adjusting when communicating with stakeholders.
