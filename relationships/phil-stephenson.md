## 2025 year-end appraisal

### His self-appraisal

#### Achievements
A big win this year was my role in helping services get their code tested and released automatically and independently, moving us closer to true continuous deployment. This shift has enabled smaller, safer releases and significantly reduced the time spent on risky, manual deployments.

I also did the groundwork for our new ephemeral development environments. The system is now built and almost ready for developers to start using, which will let them spin up a clean environment whenever they need one. A nice side effect is that this work has already forced us to clean up a lot of our service configurations. In the meantime, I am also helping prepare a 'static' ephemeral environment to give development teams a place to start testing against the latest services sooner.

I spent more time working directly with the backend teams, getting hands-on with their Java projects and tools. Even though Java isn't my preferred language, being closer to their work helped me get up to speed and meant we could solve problems faster together.

Finally, I contributed to a roadmap for our team to give us a clearer sense of direction and help us decide what to work on next. I led by example, pushing for good quality work and building tools that make other engineers' lives easier.

#### Growth Areas
The biggest opportunity I see is how we work together as a team. The change in management this year has affected our team's rhythm. Since our manager has limited availability, they can't be involved in all the day-to-day details, but we're also not self-managing in the same way we were before. To me, it feels like this has created a gap that slows down decisions and sometimes lets things fall through the cracks. The challenge now is to find a good middle ground, a way for the team to feel empowered to run with the day-to-day work, while knowing exactly when and how to pull in our manager for guidance or to get unblocked.

On a personal level, I am making it a priority to define my role with more clarity. I will take the initiative to figure out if my time is better spent on architecture and setting standards, or on building things. Establishing a clearer focus for myself is a key action I will own to improve my effectiveness.

Building on the successful collaboration I had with the backend teams, I see an opportunity to improve how I engage with other parts of engineering. At times, it can be challenging to get the help or responsiveness needed on cross-team issues, which can slow down progress. I will get better at building these partnerships across the company. This means being more proactive in communicating what our team is working on, taking the time to understand the priorities of other teams, and finding common goals so we can tackle shared problems more effectively together.

My focus will also be on rebuilding trust in our release and test process. When things are flaky, it's frustrating and slows everyone down. I will improve our testing strategy by pushing for more unit and integration tests, especially for parts of the system that are difficult to test end-to-end. A top priority will be improving our test coverage at build time, which means actively fixing or removing flaky tests and, where it makes sense, replacing them with more reliable integration tests. Looking further ahead, I plan to contribute to creating a workflow orchestrator to bring a greater level of automation to the entire development lifecycle.

Finally, I will continue focusing on improving the overall developer experience and tooling. The goal is to reduce friction in the development lifecycle and make it easier for engineers to build, test, and ship code with confidence.

#### Final Summary
I am proud of the tangible progress made this year, particularly in automating releases, advancing ephemeral environments, and deepening collaboration with backend teams. These foundations have already made our delivery safer and more predictable.

Looking ahead, my primary focus is to help optimise our team's operating model. I want to establish a rhythm that empowers the team to self-manage day-to-day execution while effectively utilising our manager's guidance when needed. This will help us regain speed and ensure clear ownership.

I will also work to define my role with greater clarity, allowing me to focus on high-impact areas like improving the developer experience and extending cross-team partnerships. To support this, I would value having a clear progression framework in place. As the company expands, having a plan ready for how our team structure and individual roles will evolve will ensure we are prepared to scale effectively.

By prioritising the full automation of our release and testing processes, enforcing clear infrastructure standards, and driving quicker decisions, I am confident we can turn our current operational challenges into a strength. This focus will allow us to scale our platform effectively and deliver a seamless experience for the engineering team.

### My appraisal of Phil

#### Impact
Phil is a strong performer who has had a great year in terms of impact.

His commitment to doing things the right way continues to be a significant strength: Phil knows what good looks like and cares to advocate for it, while being willing to compromise where that's pragmatic.  

Phil works hard, with an admirable ability to balance competing threads of work.  His self appraisal identifies several projects he has contributed on, but undersells the bredth of his contribution.  For example, he makes no mention of his contribution to the FinCrime team, which was considerable and handled while staying involved in other DevOps work.

He has provided good high-level thought leadership during conversations on a roadmap for the team, identifying some key deliverables.

#### Growth Areas
Phil has shown a good instinct for thinking about process and how the team operates. I'd encourage him to develop that further by identifying and proposing practical solutions - he's well placed to help shape how we work.

Phil is already seen as the de facto tech lead for the team. As a development opportunity, I'd encourage him to consider ways he can raise his visibility as a direction-setter more broadly across the organisation.

## Running Notes

### 2025-02-04 1:1

**Appraisal feedback discussion**
- Discussed the feedback I had written for him — he agreed it aligned well with his own take.

**On the tone of his self-appraisal**
- I made the point that I'm open to constructive feedback, but using the appraisal as a channel to escalate wasn't appropriate — it looks undiplomatic.
- He asserted he was trying to be constructive, not damaging, but acknowledged my view that the channel wasn't the right one.
- He didn't say whether he agreed, but acknowledged and respected my perspective.

**Discussing the perceived gaps**
- We discussed at length where he thinks the gaps are and what has changed since I took line management.
- He struggled to put his finger on anything specific.
- Couldn't identify much that has changed since I took over, except that the team also lost Kevin Came's involvement as scrum master.

**Path forward**
- I shared my view that if I'm going to lean in to the gaps, I'll need the team to work in a more structured fashion.
- Proposed adopting a hybrid kanban/scrum model: scrum for planned work, kanban for reactive work.
- Also: more discipline around scrum, and aligning sprints with other engineering teams.
- Phil seemed very open to trying this.
- Agreed we would discuss with the rest of the team, but I already have a strong view on what needs to happen.
