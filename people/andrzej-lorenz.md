VP of Engineering, based in Krakow. My line manager.

## Notes

### 2026-02-16 — 1:1

- **Michal backfill:** role being submitted for approval — no timeline on when approvals will come through; could be next financial year. Some uncertainty around possibility of new team. Backfill may be in London.
- Discussed Jacek — possibility of rotation, tech leadership on gateway service.
- **Confirmed Andrzej is leading the new team.**
- Team moves discussion:
  - Keen to have Michal on his new team for his breadth of vision and entrepreneurial nature. Thinks it will be a good counterpoint to the others on the team who are more detail-oriented.
  - Sam Whittaker's move to Retain should balance Mike Davis's management. Thinks Mike can look too narrowly at how to get to a solution and not enough at how that affects current system design. Sam has that broader view.
- General conversation about department organisation and organisational principles.
- **L5 FE role (Stefan):** Andrzej thinks Stefan should be considering:
  - How competent the front-end team is, what gaps it has, and how to help close them.
  - Defining an engineering roadmap for the front end.
  - Replacing Chris Walker as competency lead (with a possible move for Chris into the DevOps team as an expert on the platform for delivering FE code to prod).

### 2026-02-13 — 1:1 agenda (prepared)

- Confirm my understanding that he will be managing the new Spend Platform team. If so, let him know I'll move fee-service related tickets to his backlog once it's set up.
- Michal Baran backfill — chase status of role approval (promised but not yet approved).
- L5 FE role (Stefan) — ask his thoughts on the role. Let him know I've also broached the topic with Steve Rayko.
- Appraisals — update that I'm actively discussing my feedback for reports in 1:1s.
- DevOps team process — let him know I'm going to lean in heavily on formalising a hybrid scrum/kanban process.
