## Running Notes

### 2026-02-20 — EWA/Extra

Presented a product overview of EWA/Extra in a planning meeting. Key points: EWA is a monthly salary advance (max £100 or 20% of net salary, whichever is lower); tied to the new Extra membership tier at £2.99/month; not available in Plus; no free trial; £3 disbursement fee per use; requires open banking to verify salary.

### 2026-02-23 — BAU Epic misuse

Using the BAU/reactive maintenance Epic as a dumping ground for small, unplanned feature requests. The Epic's intended purpose is reactive toil. This approach obscures product delivery — value-adding work ends up looking like maintenance. Worth a direct conversation to align on the distinction. Raised the point in Merchant standup on 23 Feb, but Zac was absent — needs a separate conversation.

### 2026-02-18 — Pending Rewards
Asked in Slack whether expiry logic should be extended to pending rewards. Flagged the edge case: a reward could legitimately sit in a pending state for a long time (e.g. referral rewards that realise only when a referral is made). This isn't addressed in the current MVP spec — awaiting his view.
