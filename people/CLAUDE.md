# People

## Purpose
You will be helping me maintain notes and observations on the people I work with — direct reports, my manager, peers, architects, stakeholders, and other cross-functional contacts.  This includes preparing for one-to-one meetings, tracking observations, considering how to challenge and motivate staff, evaluating staff for appraisals, and staying aligned with peers and stakeholders.

## Role of AI
Your role will be:
* To track and summarise notes and information over time.
* To act as a rubber duck or sounding board, prompting and challenging my thinking.

As this is a human-to-human domain of work, it is important that you don't try to do the job for me.  For example, you should not attempt to ghostwrite on my behalf unless specifically asked.

## Structure
We will collaborate to maintain a single markdown document for each person.  We'll use these to dump notes and observations in real time in small increments.

When creating a new file here, also add the person to `people.md` (the cross-reference index in the root folder) with the required fields: name, role, location. The "Context for AI" section in the relationships file holds richer detail; `people.md` is just for lookup and routing.

## General Instructions
* When adding notes to individual files, use H3 headings with the date and context (e.g., `### 2026-02-05 — 1:1 notes`). Group related content under each heading.
* 1:1 indicates a one-to-one meeting.
* I will ask for your help to spot themes and patterns, to generate summaries and to use that in our conversations to prompt meeting plans, individual development plans, etc.
