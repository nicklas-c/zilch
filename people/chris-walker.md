Competency Lead for Front End Engineering, based in London. Reports to Rob Nelson.

## Running Notes

### Nick Gilbert 1:1 — 2026-02-12

Nick G raised that Chris is pressing him on delivery for the server-side rendering project. Observation: Chris is a very good engineer, but his project management skills sometimes lack — the ADR still isn't done and approved, yet he's pressing ahead. Agreed with Rob Nelson to treat the work as planned rather than reactive.

### 1:1 with Andrzej — 2026-02-16

Andrzej floated the idea that Stefan Amarie could replace Chris as FE competency lead, with Chris potentially moving into the DevOps team as an expert on the platform for delivering FE code to production.
