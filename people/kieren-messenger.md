## Observations

### 2026-02-18 — Pending Rewards
Identified as the next blocker on pending rewards: once Nick Holt's design doc is reviewed, the work will be gated on Kieren producing designs for how pending rewards are displayed to the customer.

### 2026-02-12 — Sprint demo
Announced in the demo meeting chat that the Merchant team would be picking up a specific piece of work in an upcoming sprint. This is outside his remit — planning and scope commitments are the EM's responsibility. Noted as part of a pattern of stepping outside his lane.

### 2026-02-11 — Pro status meeting
Noted no huge movement on UK partnership designs.
