#### Talking Points (pre-meeting)

1. **Appraisal** — share and discuss year-end appraisal feedback.
2. **Piotr's ZOE presentation** — seek Nick G's feedback on Piotr's recent presentation to the DevOps team on his ZOE work.

#### Notes

**Server-side rendering pressure**
- Led with concern that Chris Walker is pressing him on delivery for the server-side rendering project.
- I noted that I'd already spoken with Rob Nelson about it and we agreed to treat it as planned work.
- Chris is a very good engineer, but his project management skills sometimes lack — visible in the fact that the ADR still isn't done and approved, yet he's pressing ahead regardless.

**DevOps Scrum process — when to start**
- Discussed a deadline to get started with a proper Scrum process.
- Nick suggested next iteration start.
- I pushed for sooner — ideally with the quality sprint.
- Agreed to resolve the timing asynchronously.

**tech-devops channel noise**
- Observed that the tech-devops channel gets very noisy.
- Agreed an action to set up a firefighter tag so that not everyone on the team is alerted on every message or reply.

**Appraisal**
- Discussed what I can and can't share, and how I approached writing it.
- Discussed content of his self-appraisal.
- Slightly odd segue into the merits and demerits of different package managers.
- He commented on the perception that his pace of work can drop slightly. Thinks it's not his pace but that he doesn't always clearly communicate blockers.
- Other than that, he feels the appraisal is fair and accurate.

**Piotr's ZOE presentation**
- Looks clearly laid out; big chunky piece of work.
- Understands why Piotr ran with it and got it done on his own, but tone suggests he's not delighted about that.
- Thinks it needs more comments to help him as a non-Go expert.
- Discussed Go's idiomatic godoc approach — could give leverage to push for better documentation. Could also use AI for codebase analysis.
- Implementation itself is good.
- Concern that Piotr submitted a large volume of code in one go without iterative peer review. I let Nick know that similar feedback has been given to Piotr and that I think he has taken it on board.
- I asked if this is a bit of a theme with Piotr. Nick said it can be — Piotr similarly went off piste with the Crossplane work for Ephemeral Environments, and stability was adversely affected as a result.

**Feedback for me**
- Needs me to lean in soon on taking over the on-call rota.

**Other**
- He's no longer sure who is leading the Platform team.
