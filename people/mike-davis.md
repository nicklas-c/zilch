### 2026-02-23 — Rory Fielding escalation

Raised Rory's behaviour during the RN Architecture release dispute — specifically the direct message to Ossie bypassing me. Mike confirmed he is handling it: minor behaviours already being addressed through appraisals; the more serious behaviour will be raised with Rory directly. Situation handed over.

### 1:1 with Andrzej — 2026-02-16

Andrzej's observation: thinks Mike can look too narrowly at how to get to a solution and not enough at how that affects current system design. Sam Whittaker's move to Retain is intended to provide that broader perspective.
