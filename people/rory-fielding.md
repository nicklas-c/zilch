### 2026-02-23 — RN Architecture release dispute

Pushed via Slack for Ossie Nwokedi to immediately pick up ZILCH-48665 (keyboard stays open after search, RN architecture build), dropping in-progress sprint work. Escalated quickly when I asked for clarification on whether the ticket was a bug or tech debt, framing my question as a "refusal". Attempted to lecture me on how Scrum should handle unplanned work — this is outside his remit.

Subsequently sent a private message directly to Ossie asking him to pick up the ticket, deliberately bypassing me. This is poor behaviour: it undermines my authority as EM and puts Ossie in an uncomfortable position.

Escalated to Mike Davis. Mike to decide whether to have the conversation himself or involve me.

**General pattern:** Rory has overseen the RN Architecture project from the outset. Overall impression is that he has been chaotic in his management of it throughout.
