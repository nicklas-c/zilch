### 2026-02-23 — RN Architecture release dispute

Pushed via Slack for Ossie Nwokedi to immediately pick up ZILCH-48665 (keyboard stays open after search, RN architecture build), dropping in-progress sprint work. Escalated quickly when I asked for clarification on whether the ticket was a bug or tech debt, framing my question as a "refusal". Attempted to lecture me on how Scrum should handle unplanned work — this is outside his remit.

Subsequently sent a private message directly to Ossie asking him to pick up the ticket, deliberately bypassing me. This is poor behaviour: it undermines my authority as EM and puts Ossie in an uncomfortable position.

Escalated to Mike Davis. Mike to decide whether to have the conversation himself or involve me.

Later the same day, Rory arranged for an engineer on another team to pick up ZILCH-48665, without informing me. I had already committed to bringing it into sprint planning the following day. Only discovered this by chance. A further instance of bypassing the agreed process — and this time after a clear commitment had been made.

Escalation resolved: met with Mike Davis. Minor behaviours already being addressed through appraisals. The direct contact with Ossie will be raised with Rory specifically by Mike. Situation closed from my side.

**General pattern:** Rory has overseen the RN Architecture project from the outset. Overall impression is that he has been chaotic in his management of it throughout.
