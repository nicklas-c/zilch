Chris Walker asked Nick Gilbert what the pen-testers should particularly focus on for the new web app, following completion of production deployment work. No output from that conversation visible in the digest.

Refinement meeting with DevOps team to task out ZILCH-47773 (prepare environments for customer-web-app deployments). Also added ZILCH-48449 (infrastructure remediation for pen test findings) to the epic. Estimated effort: could take the full sprint.

Rob Nelson raised concern that dev/staging setup vs productionised environments could involve significantly more work. Agreed to prioritise for DevOps Sprint 11.4 (starting next week). Target: ready by end of the iteration, giving Sprint 11.5 to finalise.
