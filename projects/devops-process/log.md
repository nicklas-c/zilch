Planning meeting that was supposed to happen on the 17th was cancelled (forgotten when the announcement was sent). All three remaining devops-process tasks promoted to Next — aiming to close off the initiative today: review backlog track assignments with the team, set up refinement and backlog prioritisation meetings, and extend Merchant stand-up from 15 to 20 minutes.

Set up new series of sprint planning meetings for the DevOps team. Rescheduled Merchant and DevOps stand-ups to give more time for the Merchant stand-up and improve the chance of making the DevOps one on time. Scheduled regular refinement meetings for the DevOps team. All ceremony meetings now in place. Only remaining devops-process task: review backlog track assignments with the team.

Published operating model announcement to engineering-wide Slack channel: hybrid Scrum/Kanban from Sprint 11.4, with fixed capacity reserved for reactive work. Key message: foreseeable work should be raised early for sprint planning; urgent items still handled reactively.

Completed Jira setup and communicated to the team. Two boards: "DevOps Reactive" (Kanban, continuation of existing board) and a new Planned board (Scrum). Items appear on one or the other based on a `reactive` label. Sprints created through to the end of the next iteration. A stub sprint for 11.3 holds in-flight work. Columns kept deliberately simple (To Do, In Progress, Done) to start — will refine with the team. Tomorrow's planning meeting repurposed to sort tickets into the correct boards and talk through backlog management approach.

Refined and tasked out ZILCH-47773 (prepare environments for customer-web-app deployments) with the team. Agreed with Rob Nelson to prioritise for Sprint 11.4 (starting next week). Outcome: work planned into the first sprint under the new Scrum model rather than taken on reactively — process preserved while still meeting stakeholder needs.
