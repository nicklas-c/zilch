# Stefan Onboarding

## Also Known As
Stefan's onboarding, FE L5 onboarding, Alex backfill onboarding

## Context

Stefan is joining the Merchant team on 23 March 2026 as a Front End Engineer (Level 5).  He is Alex Murphy's backfill, but more than a like-for-like replacement: he will be the most senior FE engineer on the team and the first L5 FE at Zilch.

He has previous FinTech experience, though his most recent role is not FinTech.  Alex noted that he was pleased we're getting a very experienced FE engineer as his replacement.

**What this onboarding needs to achieve:**
- Company-wide onboarding is handled by HR separately.  This project covers team-specific and role-specific onboarding only.
- No immediate handover of in-flight work — Alex's work has been redistributed — but there are significant pieces of work Stefan should be aware of.
- As an L5, he doesn't need a buddy or coach.  What he needs is to establish key contacts across the work network quickly.
- Alex's advice for his successor: lean into the chaos; Zilch treats firefighting as BAU; don't let that stress you out.  Chris Walker is great as the FE competency lead but doesn't have a huge amount of experience.

## Personnel

- Stefan — the new starter
- Chris Walker — FE competency lead (will be a key relationship)

## Running Notes

### 2026-02-09

- Created this project to plan Stefan's onboarding.
- Key context gathered: L5 hire, prior FinTech experience, company onboarding handled separately, no in-flight handover needed, needs network-building not coaching.
- Identified key contacts for introductions:
  - **Zac Barclay** — Product Manager, closest product partner
  - **Ozzie Yuce** — SVP of Product, key decision-maker
  - **Steve Rayko** — SVP of Engineering
  - **Sam Whittaker** — L5 BE engineer, his BE counterpart at the same level
  - **Saeed Aghaee** — Architect
  - **Abhishek Chatterjee** — Architect
  - **Andrzej Lorenz** — VP of Engineering (our line manager)
  - **Chris Walker** — FE competency lead
  - **Phil Stephenson** — DevOps tech lead
  - **Matt Swirski** — Platform team
  - **Kevin Came** — Product Delivery Manager
  - **Parry Champaneriya** — Scrum Master
- Identified significant pieces of work Stefan should be briefed on:
  - Maestro test pack
  - Server-side rendering project
  - New architecture
  - Desire to move to a more modular FE architecture
  - ContentStack (Alex documented and walked through before leaving)
- Chris Walker dynamic: Chris was on the selection panel and is excited to learn from Stefan. No difficult conversation needed. But the implications for Chris's future as FE competency lead are unclear — need to clarify with Chris's manager before speaking to Chris directly.
- Messaged Rob Nelson (9 Feb, evening) asking about his thinking on how Stefan's L5 arrival affects Chris's position as FE competency lead. Awaiting reply.
- Open questions to return to:
  - What team-specific tooling access does he need beyond what HR will set up? (Repo access, LaunchDarkly, ContentStack, Slack channels, etc.)
  - What should his first piece of work be?
  - How structured should the first week be — planned schedule of meetings and walkthroughs, or more organic given his seniority?
