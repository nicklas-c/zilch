- Discussed with Abhishek Chatterjee in 1:1. He clarified that gateway service isn't something he's tracking — it sits with Saeed. Informed him that Jacek will be leading the cross-team effort.

Stand-up update: Jacek is working on deploying the authoriser Lambda (ZILCH-40366) to pre-prod today. Needs review today. Tomasz Surowiec is interested in making use of the new gateway service too. Jacek raised a question about whether to use a new gateway or proxy through customer-service — I need to understand the thinking better.
