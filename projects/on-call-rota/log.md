# On Call Rota

## Also Known As

On Call, Incident Response Rota

## Context

24/7 incident response rota staffed by engineers from the DevOps and Platform teams. Has lacked managerial oversight since the Platform team manager left — currently self-organised with Matt Swirski (Platform) coordinating.

Nicklas is taking ownership as part of managing the DevOps team. The goal is to provide the managerial oversight that's been missing, not necessarily to change how the rota operates day-to-day.

### Tooling

- Rota is managed in Jira Ops: https://payzilch.atlassian.net/jira/ops/teams/og-1e258c57-ef25-4b34-9772-49388624ebf0/on-call

### Open Questions

- How are shifts decided — is it mostly self-organised?
- What does Matt Swirski's current coordination role involve?
- Why is Paul Batey (Platform) not on the rota?

## Running Notes

### 2026-02-18

Regular rota review meeting scheduled. First session on 2 March.

**Agenda for the first few sessions (information-gathering only):**
- Set the expectation upfront: no solutionising yet, just data gathering.
- Walk through every alert from the previous fortnight.
- For each alert, understand it well enough to reason about root cause.
- After a month or two of data points, shift to looking for patterns and solutions.

### 2026-02-09

Project created. Two immediate actions identified:
1. Find out from the DevOps team how the rota is captured in tools, how shifts are decided, and how self-organised it is.
2. Set up a regular meeting with on-call staff to review upcoming tickets.
