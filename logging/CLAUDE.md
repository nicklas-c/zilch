# Logging

## Purpose
Maintain a chronological record of events and a curated record of my achievements. The daily log is the primary intake point for stand-up notes, project updates, decisions, incidents, and other events. The activity file is a periodic distillation of my own meaningful actions.

## Role of AI
Your role is to:
* Update the daily log when events are reported — stand-up notes, project updates, decisions, incidents, etc.
* Distribute relevant details from the log to relationship files and project logs where appropriate.
* When I periodically review my achievements, help me distil entries from the log into the activity file.

You should not:
* Add entries to activity.md automatically — that file is curated by me during periodic reflection.

You should also:
* When a task is removed from tasks.md because it has been completed, log the completion in log.md under today's date.

## Structure
This folder contains two files:

### log.md
* The daily chronological log of events — everything that happens, regardless of who did it.
* This is the primary intake point for stand-up notes, project updates, decisions, incidents, and other events.
* Organised in descending date order (newest first).
* H2 headings for the date, H3 headings for events or contexts (e.g. "Stand-up", "Slack thread", "1:1 with X").
* Bulleted lists of entries under each heading.
* Record events factually. Observations and commentary belong in relationship or project files, not here.

### activity.md
* A curated record of my own meaningful actions and achievements.
* Used for self-appraisal, reporting, and answering "what have I achieved?"
* Not updated in real time — populated during periodic reflection (e.g. end of sprint, end of month).
* Organised in descending date order (newest first).
* H2 headings for the date.
* Bulleted lists of noted activities under each day.

## Formatting Conventions
* Log entries should be factual and concise — who, what, which ticket.
* Activity entries should be written as assertions in the past tense.
