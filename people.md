# People

## Guidelines for AI
This document lists people in my orbit at Zilch.  Use it as a reference when handling prompts that reference people.  You have agency to update this file with additional information as it emerges - either adding people to the list, or adding or modifying notes on individuals.

**Scope of updates:** Add people when they become relevant to ongoing work.  Note professionally useful context — role, team, location, involvement in projects, working patterns — but avoid biographical detail that doesn't serve management purposes.  Aim for enough information to provide context, not a personnel file.
