# People

## Guidelines for AI
This is an index of people in my work network containing basic reference information in tabular format.  It should not be used for storing rich or narrative information.  Instead, each person has a row in the table, with strictly defined columns.

Where relevant, richer information logs are stored in the folder ./people/ on a file-per-person basis.

Maintain this index in alphabetical order by full name.

### Fields
Observe these data integrity rules when updating this file.  Request clarifications if you cannot confidently infer the information.

|---|---|---|
| Name | Required | Person's full name; request clarification if the name appears to be incomplete |
| Role | Required | |
| Location | Required | |
| Team | Optional | |
| Reports To | Optional | Referential integrity: where this field is filled, ensure the person refered to is in this index |
| Projects | Optional | A comma-separated list of references to projects the person is associated with. Project names should match a folder name in ./projects/ or ./projects/archive/ |
